# Virtual Authors

Virtual Authors is a Flarum extension which allows you to specify multiple authors for a discussion, and attribute credit to them.

This is useful for a Flarum instance which posts stories created by users, or art projects, where multiple people may need to be attributed credit for a piece of work.
