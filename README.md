## Description

Virtual Authors is a Flarum extension which allows you to specify one or more 'virtual authors' for a discussion, and attribute specific credit to them.

This is useful for a Flarum instance which posts stories created by users, or art projects, where multiple people may need to be attributed credit for a piece of work.

## What are 'Virtual Authors'?

'Virtual Authors' are models you can create to assign credit to people for their contribution to a discussion.

## Usage

You can create and edit Virtual Authors on Flarum admin dashboard:

These virtual authors can then be assigned to discussions through the controls dropdown:

From the panel at the top of discussions with Virtual Authors set, you can view all discussion which a specific author has contributed to. This page also contains a discussion count, and the Virtual Author's description:

## Options

> **Show link to all discussions by a virtual author in the 'Authors' box**

This toggles the link from the 'Authors' box at the top of a discussion to the virtual author's page listing their discussions.

> **Show authors in sidebar instead of above first post**

This toggles the location of the 'Authors' pane on discussions. This can be set to the discussion sidebar, or above the first post.

> **Show badge on discussions with Virtual Authors**

This toggles the badge shown on discussions with virtual authors.

## Future development

If desired, there is an opportunity to allow this extension to also provide the ability to set virtual authors for individual posts instead of discussions.

I don't require this feature for my use case, but if you'd like to sponsor its development, feel free to get in touch: [david+flarum-dev@davwheat.dev](mailto:david+flarum-dev@davwheat.dev).
